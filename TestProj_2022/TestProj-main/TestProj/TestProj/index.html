    <h1>Laboratory work 6</h1>
    <h2>Task 1</h2>
    <h3>Polindrome</h3>
    <p>
        <b> Write a function for finding the maximum length of a polindrome in a string.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        For reference:
        A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam, racecar.
        There are also numeric palindromes, particularly date/time stamps using short digits 11/11/11 11:11 and long digits 02/02/2020.
        Sentence-length palindromes may be written when allowances are made for adjustments to capital letters, punctuation, and word dividers, such as "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!",
        "Was it a car or a cat I saw?" or "No 'x' in Nixon".

    <h2>Task 2</h2>
    <h3>Anagram</h3>
    <p>
        This is the name of a word that contains all the letters of another word in the same quantity, but in a different order.
        What should you do:
        You need to write a function that checks if two lines are anagrams, and the case of letters does not matter.
        Only characters are taken into account; spaces or punctuation are not taken into account

    <h2>Task 3</h2>
    <h3>Vowel search</h3>
    <p>
        A fairly simple task that often comes across in interviews.
        What should you do:
        You need to write a function that takes a string as an argument and returns the number of vowels that are contained in the string.
        Vowels are "a", "e", "i", "o", "u".

    <h2>Task 4</h2>
    <h3>Fibonacci</h3>
    <p>
        A classic task that can be found in interviews of various levels. It is worth recalling that the Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers, where each subsequent is the sum of the previous two.
        So, the first ten numbers are as follows: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>What should you do:</b>
        We need to write a function that returns the nth record in a certain sequence, and n is the number that is passed as an argument to the function.

    <p>
        Create a program that introduces three numerical values
        a, b, c - three sides of the triangle and calculates the area of ​​the triangle according
        to the Heron formula (do not forget about checking the triangle inequality!).

    <p>
        Create a program that generates 20 random numbers from the range [0, 999] and displays them in the first line of the screen.
        Then it arranges the resulting array in ascending order and prints two lines:
        The first of them contains ordered numbers, and below the neub (second line) are their serial numbers from the original generated line.

    <h2>Task 4</h2>
    <p>
        A square matrix of real numbers is given. Let Мin be the minimum value among the elements of the matrix,
        Let Max be the maximum among the elements of the matrix.
        Average - arithmetic average of all matrix elements. Find the number of rows, the arithmetic average of
        elements in which lies in the range [Min + Average / 2, Max - Average / 2].
        The matrix size is entered from the keyboard.
